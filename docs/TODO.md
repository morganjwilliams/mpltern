# TODO

## High

- Rotation of axis-labels
    - along the figure bottom
    - along the axis
- Arrows along the axes (using some transforms)
- Tick-labels inside the triangle
- Advanced examples

## Medium

- `annotate`: Adequate manipulations for `xycoords` and `textcoords`
- Crosshairs
- Isoproportion lines

## Low

- `errorbar` (implementation of error bars along ternary axes? The error bars
in ternary plots for different axes may be correlated with each other.)
- More general (hexagonal) plotting of a part of the triangle
- Parallelogram plots
- Piper diagram
- Triangular and hexagonal binning with values (like `ggtern`)
- Tie lines
- Log scale
- Scatter Hist (ternary-plot version of [this](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/axes_grid1/scatter_hist_locatable_axes.html))
